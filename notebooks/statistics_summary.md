Based on the stastical measure analysis of the solar farm for the Benin Malanville, Sierra Leone Bumbuna, and Togo Dapaong QC datasets, the following summary and recommendations can be made:

### Benin-Malanville:
1. **Solar Irradiance:** 
   - Mean values indicate moderate to high solar irradiance levels.
   - Wide range between minimum and maximum values suggests significant variability over time.

2. **Temperature:** 
   - Ambient temperature is relatively high, with a mean around 28°C.
   - Temperature across Module A and Module B is consistent, indicating uniformity in temperature readings.

3. **Relative Humidity:** 
   - Moderate variability, with a mean around 54%.
   - Fairly even spread of humidity levels based on percentiles.

4. **Wind Speed and Direction:** 
   - Mean wind speed is relatively low, around 2 m/s, with occasional gusts up to 26.6 m/s.
   - Wide range in wind direction indicates variability in wind patterns.

5. **Barometric Pressure:** 
   - Relatively stable, with a mean around 994 hPa and small standard deviation.

6. **Cleaning and Precipitation:** 
   - Infrequent cleaning events, with a mean close to zero.
   - Low precipitation levels, with a mean around 0 mm/min.

### Sierra Leone-Bumbuna:
1. **Solar Irradiance:** 
   - Moderate levels indicated by mean values.
   - Significant variability in solar irradiance.

2. **Temperature:** 
   - Ambient temperature is moderate, with a mean around 26°C.
   - Consistent temperature readings across modules.

3. **Relative Humidity:** 
   - Moderate to high variability, with a mean around 79%.
   - Skewed distribution with 25th percentile below mean and 75th percentile above mean.

4. **Wind Speed and Direction:** 
   - Low mean wind speed around 1.15 m/s, with gusts up to 23.9 m/s.
   - Wide range in wind direction indicating variability.

5. **Barometric Pressure:** 
   - Relatively stable, with a mean around 999.88 hPa.

6. **Cleaning and Precipitation:** 
   - Infrequent cleaning events.
   - Low precipitation levels, with a mean around 0.005 mm/min.

### Togo-Dapaong_qc:
1. **Solar Irradiance:** 
   - Moderate to high levels indicated by mean values.
   - Significant variability observed.

2. **Temperature:** 
   - Moderate ambient temperature, with a mean around 27.75°C.
   - Consistent temperature readings across modules.

3. **Relative Humidity:** 
   - Moderate variability, with a mean around 55%.
   - Skewed distribution similar to Sierra Leone-Bumbuna.

4. **Wind Speed and Direction:** 
   - Moderate mean wind speed around 2.37 m/s, with gusts up to 23.1 m/s.
   - Wide range in wind direction indicating variability.

5. **Barometric Pressure:** 
   - Relatively stable, with a mean around 975.92 hPa.

6. **Cleaning and Precipitation:** 
   - Infrequent cleaning events.
   - Low precipitation levels, with a mean around 0.0014 mm/min.

### Conclusion:
- Benin-Malanville and Togo-Dapaong_qc exhibit similar climate characteristics with moderate to high solar irradiance, moderate temperatures, and moderate humidity levels.
- Sierra Leone-Bumbuna also shows moderate solar irradiance but with slightly higher humidity levels compared to the other locations.
- All three locations experience relatively stable barometric pressure and infrequent cleaning events, with low precipitation levels.
- Wind patterns vary across the locations, with Benin-Malanville experiencing slightly higher mean wind speeds compared to Sierra Leone-Bumbuna and Togo-Dapaong_qc.
