For the Sierra Leone-Bumbuna dataset, the data quality check results are as follows:

1. **Missing Values**: There are no missing values in the dataset for the columns GHI, DNI, and DHI.

2. **Negative Values**: Similar to the Benin-Malanville dataset, there are a significant number of negative values in the columns GHI, DNI, and DHI. These negative values should be investigated further to understand their origin and potential impact on the analysis.

3. **Cleaning Column Values**: The 'Cleaning' column in this dataset also contains the values 0 and 1, indicating that it might be used for similar purposes as in the Benin-Malanville dataset.

**Conclusion**: The Sierra Leone-Bumbuna dataset does not have missing values but does contain a large number of negative values in the GHI, DNI, and DHI columns. These negative values should be carefully addressed during the data analysis process, and the 'Cleaning' column may be used to assist in this process. Further investigation into the nature of these negative values is recommended to ensure data quality.
