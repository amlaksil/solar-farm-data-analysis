Based on the statistical measures calculated for each numeric column, we can make several generalizations about the data distribution and characteristics:

1. **Solar Irradiance (GHI, DNI, DHI, ModA, ModB)**:
   - The mean values for these variables indicate that the solar irradiance levels are generally moderate to high.
   - There is a wide range between the minimum and maximum values, suggesting significant variability in solar irradiance over time.

2. **Temperature (Tamb, TModA, TModB)**:
   - Ambient temperature (Tamb) tends to be relatively high, with a mean around 28Â°C.
   - Temperature of Module A (TModA) and Module B (TModB) also follow a similar distribution, indicating consistency in temperature across modules.

3. **Relative Humidity (RH)**:
   - Relative humidity shows moderate variability, with a mean around 54%.
   - The distribution appears to be somewhat symmetric, with the 25th and 75th percentiles indicating a fairly even spread of humidity levels.

4. **Wind Speed and Direction (WS, WSgust, WSstdev, WD, WDstdev)**:
   - The mean wind speed is relatively low, around 2 m/s, with occasional gusts up to 26.6 m/s.
   - Wind direction shows a wide range of values, indicating variability in wind patterns.
   - Standard deviations for wind speed and direction suggest moderate variability and directional changes over time.

5. **Barometric Pressure (BP)**:
   - Barometric pressure values are relatively stable, with a mean around 994 hPa and a small standard deviation.

6. **Cleaning and Precipitation**:
   - The cleaning variable indicates that cleaning events are infrequent, with a mean close to zero.
   - Precipitation levels are generally low, with a mean around 0 mm/min and minimal variability.

Overall, the data suggests a climate that is characterized by moderate to high solar irradiance, relatively high temperatures, moderate humidity, low to moderate wind speeds with occasional gusts, stable barometric pressure, infrequent cleaning events, and low precipitation levels.
