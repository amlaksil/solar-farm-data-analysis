Based on the provided data for wind speed and wind direction analysis for the `togo-dapaong_qc` dataset, we can observe the following relationships:

1. **Wind Speed Analysis:**
   - Wind Speed (`WS`): The wind speed values vary over time, ranging from 0 to approximately 1.2 m/s. There are some instances where the wind speed reaches higher values, such as 1.2 m/s, but it generally remains below 1.0 m/s for most of the dataset.
   - Wind Gust Speed (`WSgust`): The wind gust speed values also vary over time, ranging from 0 to approximately 1.6 m/s. Similar to wind speed, there are instances where the wind gust speed reaches higher values, such as 1.6 m/s, but it generally remains below 1.0 m/s for most of the dataset.
   - Wind Speed Standard Deviation (`WSstdev`): The standard deviation of wind speed values varies over time, ranging from 0 to approximately 0.4 m/s. This indicates that the wind speed values fluctuate around their mean value, with higher standard deviations indicating more variability in wind speed.

2. **Wind Direction Analysis:**
   - Wind Direction (`WD`): The wind direction values vary over time, ranging from 0 to approximately 230 degrees. There are some instances where the wind direction reaches higher values, such as 230 degrees, but it generally remains below 180 degrees for most of the dataset. The wind direction is measured clockwise from true north.
   - Wind Direction Standard Deviation (`WDstdev`): The standard deviation of wind direction values varies over time, ranging from 0 to approximately 3.0 degrees. This indicates that the wind direction values fluctuate around their mean direction, with higher standard deviations indicating more variability in wind direction.

Overall, the analysis suggests that the `togo-dapaong_qc` dataset has varying wind speed and wind direction values, with some instances of higher wind speeds and wind gust speeds. The wind direction also varies over time, indicating changing wind patterns in the region.
