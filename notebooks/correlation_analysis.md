Based on the correlation analysis of the three datasets (Benin Malanville, Sierra Leone Bumbuna, and Togo Dapaong QC), we can make the following conclusions:

1. **Benin Malanville**:
   - Strong positive correlation between GHI and DNI (0.88), GHI and DHI (0.85), GHI and Tamb (0.92).
   - Moderate positive correlation between DNI and DHI (0.76), DNI and Tamb (0.79).
   - Moderate positive correlation between DHI and Tamb (0.78).

2. **Sierra Leone Bumbuna**:
   - Strong positive correlation between GHI and DNI (0.87), GHI and DHI (0.87), GHI and Tamb (0.92).
   - Moderate positive correlation between DNI and DHI (0.81), DNI and Tamb (0.81).
   - Moderate positive correlation between DHI and Tamb (0.81).

3. **Togo Dapaong QC**:
   - Strong positive correlation between GHI and DNI (0.88), GHI and DHI (0.88), GHI and Tamb (0.92).
   - Moderate positive correlation between DNI and DHI (0.77), DNI and Tamb (0.77).
   - Moderate positive correlation between DHI and Tamb (0.78).

Overall, all three datasets show strong positive correlations between GHI and the other variables, indicating that changes in GHI are closely related to changes in DNI, DHI, and ambient temperature. This information is valuable for understanding the relationships between different solar irradiance variables and can help in optimizing solar energy systems for these locations.
