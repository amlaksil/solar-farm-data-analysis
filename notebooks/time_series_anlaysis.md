Based on the time series analysis of the solar farm variables (GHI, DNI, DHI, and Tamb) for the Benin Malanville, Sierra Leone Bumbuna, and Togo Dapaong QC datasets, the following summary and recommendations can be made:

1. **Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI)**: 
   - Benin Malanville: GHI values range from -1.2 to -5.5 W/m².
   - Sierra Leone Bumbuna: GHI values range from -0.7 to -1.7 W/m².
   - Togo Dapaong QC: GHI values range from -1.0 to -1.7 W/m².
   - Recommendation: Benin Malanville has the highest GHI values, indicating potentially better solar energy generation potential compared to the other two locations.

2. **Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI)**: 
   - Benin Malanville: DNI values range from -0.2 to -0.1 W/m².
   - Sierra Leone Bumbuna: DNI values range from -0.1 to -0.2 W/m².
   - Togo Dapaong QC: DNI values range from -0.1 to -0.2 W/m².
   - Recommendation: Benin Malanville has slightly higher DNI values compared to Sierra Leone Bumbuna and Togo Dapaong QC, indicating better direct sunlight conditions for solar energy generation.

3. **Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI)**: 
   - Benin Malanville: DHI values range from -1.1 to -5.8 W/m².
   - Sierra Leone Bumbuna: DHI values range from -0.8 to -3.4 W/m².
   - Togo Dapaong QC: DHI values range from -0.8 to -3.4 W/m².
   - Recommendation: Benin Malanville has higher DHI values compared to Sierra Leone Bumbuna and Togo Dapaong QC, indicating potentially better diffuse radiation conditions for solar energy generation.

4. **Ambient Temperature (Tamb)**: 
   - Benin Malanville: Tamb values range from 23.1°C to 26.2°C.
   - Sierra Leone Bumbuna: Tamb values range from 21.9°C to 24.0°C.
   - Togo Dapaong QC: Tamb values range from 24.8°C to 25.4°C.
   - Recommendation: Togo Dapaong QC has the most stable Tamb values, which could be beneficial for solar energy system performance.

Based on the analysis, Benin Malanville appears to outperform Sierra Leone Bumbuna and Togo Dapaong QC in terms of solar energy generation potential, especially in terms of GHI and DHI values. However, other factors such as land availability, infrastructure, and local regulations should also be considered when deciding on the location for a solar farm plant.
