For the Togo-Dapaong dataset, the data quality check results are as follows:

1. **Missing Values**: There are no missing values in the dataset for the columns GHI, DNI, and DHI.

2. **Negative Values**: There are no negative values in the DNI and DHI columns. However, there is a significant number of negative values in the GHI column.

3. **Cleaning Column Values**: Similar to the other datasets, the 'Cleaning' column contains the values 0 and 1.

**Conclusion**: The Togo-Dapaong dataset has no missing values, but it does contain a large number of negative values in the GHI column. These negative values should be carefully examined to understand their nature and potential impact on the analysis. The 'Cleaning' column may be used to assist in identifying and handling these negative values during data processing.
