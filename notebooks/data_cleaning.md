To clean the dataset by handling anomalies and missing values, especially in
columns like Comments which appear entirely null, you can use the following
approach:

1. Drop columns with entirely null values (e.g., Comments).
2. Handle missing values in other columns (e.g., fill with the mean or median).
3. Remove outliers or incorrect entries.
