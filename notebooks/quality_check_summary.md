When comparing the data quality check results for the Benin-Malanville, Sierra Leone-Bumbuna, and Togo-Dapaong datasets, several key differences and similarities can be observed:

1. **Missing Values**: All three datasets have no missing values in the GHI, DNI, and DHI columns, indicating that the data is relatively complete in terms of these variables.

2. **Negative Values**: 
   - Benin-Malanville and Sierra Leone-Bumbuna have a significant number of negative values in the GHI, DNI, and DHI columns, indicating potential issues with data collection or entry.
   - Togo-Dapaong, on the other hand, has no negative values in the DNI and DHI columns, but does have a large number of negative values in the GHI column.

3. **Cleaning Column Values**: 
   - All three datasets have a 'Cleaning' column with values 0 and 1, suggesting that this column is used for flagging or identifying certain data points for cleaning or processing.

**Summary**:
- Benin-Malanville and Sierra Leone-Bumbuna have similar issues with negative values in the GHI, DNI, and DHI columns, indicating a potential systematic issue with data collection or processing in these datasets.
- Togo-Dapaong stands out for having no negative values in the DNI and DHI columns, but does have a significant number of negative values in the GHI column, which may require specific attention during data analysis.
- The 'Cleaning' column in all three datasets may be used to assist in identifying and handling negative values during data processing.

Overall, further investigation into the nature of these negative values and their potential impact on the analysis is recommended for all three datasets.
