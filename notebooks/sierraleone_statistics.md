Based on the statistical measures calculated for each numeric column, we can make several generalizations about the data distribution and characteristics:

1. **Solar Irradiance (GHI, DNI, DHI, ModA, ModB)**:
   - The mean values for these variables suggest moderate solar irradiance levels.
   - There is a wide range between the minimum and maximum values, indicating significant variability in solar irradiance.

2. **Temperature (Tamb, TModA, TModB)**:
   - The ambient temperature (Tamb) appears to be moderate, with a mean around 26Â°C.
   - Temperatures for Module A (TModA) and Module B (TModB) follow a similar distribution, indicating consistent temperature readings across modules.

3. **Relative Humidity (RH)**:
   - Relative humidity values show moderate to high variability, with a mean around 79%.
   - The distribution appears to be somewhat skewed, with the 25th percentile below the mean and the 75th percentile above the mean.

4. **Wind Speed and Direction (WS, WSgust, WSstdev, WD, WDstdev)**:
   - The mean wind speed is relatively low, around 1.15 m/s, with occasional gusts up to 23.9 m/s.
   - Wind direction shows a wide range of values, indicating variability in wind patterns.
   - Standard deviations for wind speed and direction suggest moderate variability and directional changes over time.

5. **Barometric Pressure (BP)**:
   - Barometric pressure values are relatively stable, with a mean around 999.88 hPa and a small standard deviation.

6. **Cleaning and Precipitation**:
   - The cleaning variable indicates that cleaning events are infrequent, with a mean close to zero.
   - Precipitation levels are generally low, with a mean around 0.005 mm/min and minimal variability.

Overall, the data suggests a climate characterized by moderate solar irradiance, moderate temperatures, moderate to high humidity, low to moderate wind speeds with occasional gusts, stable barometric pressure, infrequent cleaning events, and low precipitation levels.
