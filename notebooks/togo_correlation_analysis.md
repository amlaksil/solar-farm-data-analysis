Based on the correlation matrix for the Togo Dapaong QC dataset, we can observe the following correlations between the variables:

1. **GHI (Global Horizontal Irradiance)**:
   - Strong positive correlation with DNI (Direct Normal Irradiance) (0.88), indicating that as GHI increases, DNI also tends to increase.
   - Strong positive correlation with DHI (Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance) (0.88), indicating that as GHI increases, DHI also tends to increase.
   - Strong positive correlation with TModA (0.90) and TModB (0.92), indicating that as GHI increases, ambient temperatures also tend to increase.

2. **DNI (Direct Normal Irradiance)**:
   - Strong positive correlation with GHI (0.88), indicating that as DNI increases, GHI also tends to increase.
   - Moderate positive correlation with DHI (0.77), indicating that as DNI increases, DHI also tends to increase.
   - Moderate positive correlation with TModA (0.78) and TModB (0.80), indicating that as DNI increases, ambient temperatures also tend to increase.

3. **DHI (Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance)**:
   - Strong positive correlation with GHI (0.88), indicating that as DHI increases, GHI also tends to increase.
   - Moderate positive correlation with DNI (0.77), indicating that as DHI increases, DNI also tends to increase.
   - Moderate positive correlation with TModA (0.78) and TModB (0.82), indicating that as DHI increases, ambient temperatures also tend to increase.

4. **TModA (Ambient Temperature)**:
   - Strong positive correlation with GHI (0.90) and TModB (0.99), indicating that as ambient temperature measured by sensor A increases, GHI and TModB also tend to increase.
   - Moderate positive correlation with DNI (0.78) and DHI (0.78), indicating that as ambient temperature measured by sensor A increases, DNI and DHI also tend to increase.

5. **TModB (Ambient Temperature)**:
   - Strong positive correlation with GHI (0.92) and TModA (0.99), indicating that as ambient temperature measured by sensor B increases, GHI and TModA also tend to increase.
   - Moderate positive correlation with DNI (0.80) and DHI (0.82), indicating that as ambient temperature measured by sensor B increases, DNI and DHI also tend to increase.

These correlations suggest that there is a strong relationship between the variables in the Togo Dapaong QC dataset, similar to the other datasets, which can be useful for understanding how changes in one variable may affect the others in the context of solar energy generation.
