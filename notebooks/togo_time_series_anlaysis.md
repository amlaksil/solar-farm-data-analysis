Based on the time series analysis of the Togo Dapaong solar farm data, the following insights can be generalized:

1. **Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI)**: The GHI values show a pattern of variation over time, likely influenced by daily and seasonal factors. GHI tends to be higher during daylight hours and lower during the night. Seasonal variations may also be observed, with higher values in sunnier months and lower values in cloudier months. In this specific dataset, the GHI values range from -1.3 to -1.0 W/m².

2. **Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI)**: DNI values indicate the amount of solar radiation received per square meter on a surface perpendicular to the sun's rays. In the dataset, DNI values are consistently 0 W/m², which could indicate missing or incomplete data. However, in a typical scenario, DNI values would vary throughout the day and across seasons, reflecting the position of the sun in the sky and the atmospheric conditions.

3. **Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI)**: DHI values represent the solar radiation received on a horizontal surface that does not arrive on a direct path from the sun. Similar to DNI, the DHI values in this dataset are consistently 0 W/m², which may indicate missing or incomplete data. In a typical scenario, DHI values would vary based on factors such as cloud cover, which can scatter sunlight and increase diffuse radiation levels.

4. **Ambient Temperature (Tamb)**: Tamb values show the ambient temperature at the solar farm site. In the dataset, Tamb values range from 24.8°C to 25.4°C, indicating a relatively stable temperature range. Tamb values may exhibit daily and seasonal variations, with higher temperatures during the day and in warmer months.

Overall, the analysis suggests that the Togo Dapaong solar farm data may have missing or incomplete DNI and DHI values, which could impact the accuracy of the analysis. However, the GHI values and Tamb values provide insights into the solar radiation and ambient temperature patterns at the site.
